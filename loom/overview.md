# Loom

## Ideas

- Rotating cams + disks to form heddles that have minimal threading
- Comb-like beater with fins instead of the typical closed grating design
- Flexible rapier made out of a tape measure
  - Very common
  - Flexible in one direction of force, rigid in the other
  - Includes a retraction spring
- Separate geared cams controlled by their own control rods, or individually via racks, to enable fancier designs, maybe even full programmability

## Timing Stages

1. Measure out weft thread
2. Grip and cut weft thread
3. Extend rapier
4. Release weft thread
5. Retract rapier
6. Change shed
7. Extend beater
8. Retract beater
