# Loom

## Ideas

- Rotating cams + disks to form heddles that have minimal threading
- Comb-like beater with fins instead of the typical closed grating design
- Flexible rapier made out of a tape measure
  - Very common
  - Flexible in one direction of force, rigid in the other
  - Includes a retraction spring
