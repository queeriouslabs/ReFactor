# Roadmap

This roadmap tries to provide an overview of the tools that we're planning to work on, and the status of those tools. It will likely expand over time -- this document is not by any means a fixed ontology.

The order of these entries is not necessarily the order in which they will be explored.

We'll also probably expand this out into some kind of tree or graph as we consider common root tools that can be used to fabricate other tools.

# Tools

- Loom
- Yarn/Thread Spinning Machine
- Water Capture/Purification
- Clothing Assembly Machine (automatic cutting + sewing?)
- Dining Tools (cups, plates, bowls, utensils)
- Cooking Tools (pots, pans, utentils)
