# Roadmap

This roadmap tries to provide an overview of the tools that we're planning to work on, and the status of those tools. It will likely expand over time -- this document is not by any means a fixed ontology.

The order of these entries is not necessarily the order in which they will be explored.

We'll also probably expand this out into some kind of tree or graph as we consider common root tools that can be used to fabricate other tools.

# Level 0 Needs

## Food

### Chestnut Trees

BuildSoil observes that chestnut trees are an extremely useful plant that can provide nutritious food as well as shade (in virtue of not taking up much ground space). With widespread planting of chestnuts, there would be large quantities of passively produced food. Probably some kind of convenient catching-and-collecting system would be good but in terms of the plant-related labor itself, chestnut trees seem to solve that problem.

## Water

### NMSU Passive Solar Thermal Evaporators

NMSU has a very simple little design for a passive solar thermal evaporator that can produce around 1 gallon of pure water per square meter per day. Basically its a box with a glass or polycarbonate top to let light in, and a dark fabric lining on the bottom to absorb water and heat. The evaporated water condenses on the glass/polycarbonate and runs down it into a collector at the bottom.
